‚úÖ GITHUB DEPLOYMENT FOLDER IS READY!

üìÅ Location: ./github-deployment/

This folder contains EVERYTHING you need to upload to GitHub:

- All documentation
- All configuration files
- Example environment files
- NO sensitive data

TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB:
1. Open the "github-deployment" folder
2. Select ALL contents inside it
3. Upload to GitHub using any method in UPLOAD_TO_GITHUB.md

IMPORTANT:
- Upload the CONTENTS of github-deployment, not the folder itself
- This keeps your actual project with .env files safe

3. Both services will connect directly to your GitHub repo

Your project is ready for deployment! üöÄ
