The transactions are entirely handled by the exchange provider the users choose. On these instant exchanges the user doesn't always have to create a user account, but they do leave a trail of information regarding their device and connection.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">To clarify how Trocador operates:</p>
<ul class=""font_8"">
  <li><p class=""font_8"">The user inputs which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryptocurrencies and amounts they wish to swap/exchange;</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">We search for the rates the listed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchanges would offer for that trade and present that information to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user;</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">The user selects which exchange &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they want to use and inputs the <strong>receiving address</strong> they want the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provider to send the funds to after the swap;</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">The trade is generated <u><em><strong>by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the exchange provider on their server</strong></em></u></p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">We collect the information about &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the generated trade with the provider and display this information to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user;</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">The user transfers their funds to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chosen provider's<strong> deposit address</strong>, At this stage, <u><em><strong>the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange provider is expected to perform AML checks on the funds</strong></em></u>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or follow other specific compliance requirements. If the funds are deemed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safe, the exchange provider swaps them and sends it to the user's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiving address;</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">We reiterate that the customer's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counterparty is always the chosen provider, as stated in our Terms of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service.</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">If the user fails to deposit the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funds to the provider's deposit address before a given deadline (specific &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to each provider), the transaction's status will be listed as<strong> Expired &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or Waiting</strong>. These transactions were initiated, but never completed, so &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no associated deposit should be expected in the User's receiving address. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes halted transactions (due to failed AML assessments on the part &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the provider) might also be listed as waiting or expired;</p></li>
</ul>
<p class=""font_8"">As the transaction is executed entirely by the exchange provider, any account registration or KYC requirements would be handled by them, according to their compliance requirements. However, as mentioned, the user does leave a trail of information, which we store for cases like this, and in accordance to the providers requests.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">The information we have about the orders are (at the moment they chose the exchange provider):</p>
<ul class=""font_8"">
  <li><p class=""font_8"">IP from the device,</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">UserAgent,</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">AcceptLang,</p></li>
  <li><p class=""font_8"">User Browsing Session ID: used to uniquely &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify when an internet browser connects to our platform. This can be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used to more assertively tell when the same computer was used to make &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple transactions before the browser history was erased, or a certain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time has passed. This can be ascertained when there are multiple &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactions sharing the same Browsing Session ID.</p></li>
