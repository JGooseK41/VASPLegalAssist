# VASP Records Assistant - Bug Reports and Improvement Recommendations

## Critical Bugs Found

### Bug #1: Encryption Initialization Race Condition
**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** Template Manager
**Environment:** All browsers

**Description:**
The Template Manager has a race condition where it tries to load templates before encryption is fully initialized, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Clear browser cache/storage
2. Login to application
3. Immediately navigate to Templates
4. Observe loading state that never completes

**Current Behavior:**
- Templates fail to load with "Encryption not ready" error
- User must refresh page multiple times
- Sometimes encryption keys are not properly initialized

**Expected Behavior:**
- Encryption should initialize before any API calls
- Clear loading state with progress indicator
- Automatic retry mechanism

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// In TemplateManager.js
useEffect(() => {
  if (encryptedAPI) {
    loadTemplates();
  }
}, [encryptedAPI, encryption.isKeyReady]);
```
The dependency array causes multiple re-renders and API calls.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement proper encryption initialization sequence
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Show clear user feedback during initialization
4. Add fallback for non-encrypted mode

### Bug #2: Template Creation Missing Validation
**Severity:** High
**Component:** Template Creation Form
**Environment:** Backend API

**Description:**
Based on recent commits, `agencyAddress` validation is missing, allowing templates to be created with invalid data.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Templates
2. Create new template
3. Leave agency address blank
4. Submit form
5. Template created without address

**Impact:**
- Documents generated with incomplete headers
- Legal compliance issues
- Data integrity problems

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Add frontend validation for required fields
2. Implement backend validation middleware
3. Add data migration for existing templates

---

### Bug #3: Batch Processing Memory Leak
**Severity:** High
**Component:** Batch Document Builder
**Environment:** Chrome/Firefox on large batches

**Description:**
Processing large CSV files (100+ rows) causes browser memory to spike and eventually crash.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create CSV with 500 rows
2. Upload to batch processor
3. Start processing
4. Monitor browser memory usage
5. Browser crashes around row 200

**Root Cause:**
- All documents held in memory simultaneously
- No chunking or streaming implementation
- React state updates for each row

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement batch chunking (process 10 at a time)
2. Use Web Workers for processing
3. Stream results to disk instead of memory
4. Add progress saving to resume after crash

---

### Bug #4: Mobile Touch Event Handling
**Severity:** Medium
**Component:** VASP Search Dropdown
**Environment:** iOS Safari, Android Chrome

**Description:**
Dropdown menus don't respond properly to touch events on mobile devices.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open app on mobile device
2. Navigate to document creation
3. Try to select VASP from dropdown
4. Dropdown closes immediately on touch

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement proper touch event handlers
2. Add touch-friendly UI components
3. Increase touch target sizes to 44px minimum
4. Add haptic feedback for selections

---

### Bug #5: Concurrent Session Conflicts
**Severity:** Medium
**Component:** Authentication System
**Environment:** Multiple browser tabs/windows

**Description:**
Opening the app in multiple tabs causes session conflicts and unexpected logouts.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Login in Tab 1
2. Open app in Tab 2
3. Perform actions in both tabs
4. One tab gets logged out randomly

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement proper session synchronization
2. Use BroadcastChannel API for tab communication
3. Add session conflict resolution
4. Show clear messaging about multiple sessions
