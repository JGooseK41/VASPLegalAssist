   - **Public/Private**: Your choice
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** check any boxes:

     - ‚ùå Don't add license
4. Click **Create repository**

## Step 3: Upload Your Files

After creating, GitHub will show a page with instructions. 

**Choose: "uploading an existing file"** (blue link)

1. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Open your `github-deployment` folder on your computer
3. Select ALL contents inside (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
4. Drag everything to the GitHub upload area
5. Add commit message: "Initial commit - Complete VASP Legal Assistant"
6. Click **Commit changes**

## Step 4: Reconnect Your Services

### Netlify:
- Should auto-detect the new repo
- If not: Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Link to Git ‚Üí Link to a different repository

### Render:
- Go to your service dashboard
- Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
- Disconnect and reconnect GitHub
- Select your new repository

## Alternative: Keep the Same Repository

If you want to avoid reconnecting services:

1. **Don't delete the repository**
2. Instead, go to the main page
3. Click on each folder ‚Üí Delete (trash icon)
4. Delete all files one by one
5. Then upload all new files

This keeps your connections to Netlify/Render intact!

## Quick Command Line Method (After Creating New Repo):

```bash
cd github-deployment
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Complete VASP Legal Assistant"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/JGooseK41/VASPLegalAssist.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Which Method is Best?

- **Delete & Recreate**: Cleanest approach, but need to reconnect services
- **Delete Files Only**: Keeps service connections, bit more tedious
- **Command Line**: Fastest if you're comfortable with Git

All methods work - choose what's most comfortable for you! üöÄ
