# ðŸ”§ Fix Render Deployment

## The Issue
Your Render deployment is failing because:
1. The Prisma schema was set to use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
2. Render provides PostgreSQL, not SQLite

## The Fix

### Step 1: Update schema.prisma in GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Change line 10 from:
   ```prisma
   provider = "sqlite"
   ```
   to:
   ```prisma
   provider = "postgresql"
   ```
5. Commit the change

### Step 2: Update Build Command in Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
4. Update the Build Command to:
   ```bash
   npm install && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
   ```
   
   Note: We use `db push` instead of `migrate deploy` for initial setup

### Step 3: Ensure Database URL is Set

1. In Render dashboard â†’ Environment
2. Make sure you have `DATABASE_URL` set to your PostgreSQL Internal Database URL
3. It should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database
   ```

### Step 4: Trigger Manual Deploy

1. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
2. Watch the logs to ensure it builds successfully

## Alternative: Complete File Replacement

If you prefer, replace your entire `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` with the file from:
`github-deployment/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

This file is already configured for PostgreSQL.

## After Successful Deploy

Your backend should be live at:
`https://your-service.onrender.com`

Test the health endpoint:
`https://your-service.onrender.com/api/health`

## Still Having Issues?

Check these:
1. âœ… PostgreSQL database is created and running in Render
2. âœ… DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. âœ… schema.prisma has `provider = "postgresql"`
4. âœ… Build logs show "Generated Prisma Client"
