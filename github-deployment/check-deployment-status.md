# Deployment Status Check

## Current Issue
Users are getting 404 errors when trying to verify email. This indicates the backend hasn't deployed the latest changes.

## Changes Waiting to Deploy

1. **Email Verification Route Fix** (Commit: f15b8e7)
   - Changed from POST to GET for `/api/auth/verify-email`
   - Added support for both methods during transition

2. **Fallback Support** (Commit: 85fb963)
   - Backend now accepts token from both query params and body
   - Ensures compatibility during deployment

## How to Check Deployment Status

### 1. Check Render Dashboard
- Log into Render.com
- Check the deploy status for `vasplegalassist`
- Look for the latest commit hash: `6db0e25`

### 2. Test the Endpoint
You can test if the new routes are deployed by checking:
```bash
# This should work once deployed (GET method)
curl https://vasplegalassist.onrender.com/api/auth/verify-email?token=test

# Expected response once deployed:
# {"error":"Invalid verification link. Please check your email for the correct link or request a new one.","code":"INVALID_TOKEN"}
```

### 3. Manual Deployment Trigger
If the deployment hasn't started:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" 
3. Select the latest commit from main branch

## Temporary Workaround
Until the backend deploys, users experiencing issues can:
1. Wait for the backend to deploy (usually 5-10 minutes)
2. Use the "Resend Verification" option after deployment
3. Contact support for manual verification

## Timeline
- Frontend (Netlify): Usually deploys within 2-3 minutes ✓
- Backend (Render): Can take 5-15 minutes depending on build queue ⏳
